Welcome to my collection of resources for modding **Friday Night Funkin'**. Whether you're a seasoned modder or just starting out, these tools, templates, and tutorials will help you bring your ideas to life. Below is a list of resources with brief descriptions of each.

## DISCLAIMER

I am not the owner of all of these. I will specify whoever made them. If there is no definition of who made it, then it's made by me.

## Resources

### 1. [FNFizer {creator is anonymous}](https://github.com/BobbyDrawz/FunkinModdinResources/releases/tag/fnfizer)

This FL Studio preset is not mine, but is pretty useful for making FNF-style vocals, with settings for reverb, delay, bitcrush, compression, and panning. This re-release also includes a custom unedited no-pitch-fx Boyfriend DWP by me [custom chromatic by loganMcOof].

### 2. [Psych Engine PackGen](https://github.com/BobbyDrawz/FunkinModdinResources/releases/tag/psychpackshit)

A C# executable that quickly generates `pack.json` files for Psych Engine mods. Customize settings like the mod's name, description, color in mod menu, and more with an easy-to-use interface. Perfect for streamlining the process of creating new modpacks.

## Tips
-For custom story mode difficulties, I like to start with a 308x67 image. Those are the dimensions of the "normal" difficulty image, which is the largest out of easy, normal, and hard diff images.
